### IMPORTANT


Seems like since 22 May 2020 they changed the liberties of the free developer keys and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost. You need to buy one of the keys intended for projects on production.

As for me, since it was just a personal project , i just put my site on production and deployed locally. As long as the page is in localhost the free version still works.

You may have to pass the requests through your backend/server for it to work.
